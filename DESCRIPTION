Description: Calculates key performance metrics commonly used in clinical performance evaluations of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical devices—including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC)—along with their 100(1−α)% confidence interval bounds (lower and upper). The results are saved in an easy-to-read tabular format.
